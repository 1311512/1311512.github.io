              No words!
              Being involved with the Camp Thailand program was a once in a lifetime experience.
              It changes your entire outlook on life and provides you with the tools to change as a person.
               Being involved in schools across Thailand to assisting Monks in the temples – this program really has it all!
                Please go and experience what I got to experience because you won’t be let down!
              <br><br><strong>Ben Walton</strong><br><br>
              Make a positive difference!
              Stepping out of my comfort zone and doing Camp Thailand was unreal.
               I have so many good memories, beach parties, teaching, waterfalls, temples.
                Thailand is an amazing country and I loved being about to make a positive difference.
            <br><br><strong>  Jess Harper</strong><br><br>
              Summer of a Lifetime!
              Going to Camp Thailand was one of the best decisions I ever made.
               I really did have the Summer of a Lifetime!

              Breathtaking!
              Worth every single penny! My experience was life changing. I loved every second of it,
              the people the kids, the reps all of them were amazing! Camp Thailand is an amazing way to travel and experience fantastic activities as every body else is in the same boat as you, traveling for the first time and Camp Thailand provide constant 24/7 support for when ever you need it, and the reps are such a laugh to be around. For myself it was my first time traveling alone and being at Camp I made a lot of friends so it made the whole experience feel so much more organized and safer along with a friendly, awesome atmosphere, and the activities were out of this world!!!
              <br><br><strong>Stacey Knox</strong><br><br>
              Exceptional, once in a lifetime experience!
              I had an amazing time in Thailand as all the reps were very helpful and friendly,
              as they always went the extra mile to make the experience great.
              The accommodation was lovely and all the trips I took part in were excellently organised. I would go back in a heart beat.
              <br><br><strong>Ryan McKay</strong><br><br>
              Life changing
              The Camp Thailand experience was one of the best adventures I have ever had.
              From the moment I arrived in Thailand to the moment I left was filled with amazing memories.
               Helping at the elephant sanctuary and teaching at the local schools.
              An experience I would recommend to anyone!
